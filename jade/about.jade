  h2 Who is Malmo?
  p A born-and-bred Tennesseean. I was educated at Memphis University School and Nashville&rsquo;s Vanderbilt University, where I earned my B.A. in English and played varsity baseball. I have been in commercial real estate my entire adult life. The first 10 years were with large, national firms, Interstate Realty (now CBRE) and Trammel Crow. I completed two years of study to become a CCIM in 1996.
  p Subsequently I was a hands-on manager of a major office building, dealing daily with the needs and problems of dozens of tenants, as well as negotiating leases. I learned all the problems tenants must deal with and to make sure that everything is spelled out carefully in the lease. I leave nothing to chance. In 1999 I opened my own office. In the last 16 years I have completed transactions with a wide variety of office and retail clients, large and small, valued in excess of $150,000,000.00
  p I handle every type of real estate transaction, including site searches, lease negotiations, buyouts, subleases, build-to-suits, consulting assignments and financing. For development clients I assist in choosing local land planners, engineers, architects and attorneys, as well as act as a liaison between local government agencies and neighborhood groups in zoning matters.
  p I will save you time, and I will save you money. Your interests will be my only concern, and I will never mislead you or tell you anything but the truth.
